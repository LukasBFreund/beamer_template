Source code for my beamer slides template

This repository contains a template-style source code of my preferred beamer design. I'd stress that this is just a simple variation of the Metropolis theme (https://github.com/matze/mtheme) and all credit goes to its creators. I store this source code here after a few people asked me for it. Enjoy!
